Blockchair.com: a great place to get your bitcoin blockchain data in csv formatCollecting bitcoin price data
Finding reliable bitcoin price data that goes back to the early days of bitcoin is a challenge. A good source for the data is the BraveNewCoin liquid index from TradingView. Unfortunately, TradingView doesn't offer CSV export functionality, but I figured there must be more people around dealing with that same wish. (The wish to convert TradingView data to a downloadable CSV file). I stumbled on a reddit post from someone who made a web based application to generate a csv file from a privately published TradingView chart. Great! Now I was able to get all historic bitcoin price data as of October 2010 from a reliable source.
